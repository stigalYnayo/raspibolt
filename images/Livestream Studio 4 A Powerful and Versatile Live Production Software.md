- **Frame-accurate Media Playback:** You can import any popular media format, loop clips, make playlists, add recordings as clips in the list, and export clips as .mp4 files for easy sharing. You can also scrub your video to find the ideal moment, trim your clip with in/out points, and set clips to autoplay with your transitions.
- **Remote Control via a Browser UI:** You can control Studio from any Chrome browser on the internet, with Studio 'WebControl', even on Android and Chromebook. You can delegate graphics and stream management tasks to other team members in remote locations while you focus on cutting the show.
